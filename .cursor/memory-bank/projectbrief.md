# SnapCircle - Ephemeral Group Sharing Platform

## Project Overview
SnapCircle (formerly SnapConnect) is an Android application built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose that enables users to create invite-only group spaces ("Circles") for sharing ephemeral photos, videos, and live moments. The platform is backed by Firebase services for authentication, storage, data management, and push notifications, with new Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) features for enhanced personalization.

## Current Status
Authentication flow with email/password implemented, basic camera functionality working, and initial snap upload capability in place. Navigation structure established with auth, home, and camera screens. Friend management system, snap sharing workflow, and basic AR filter UI implemented.

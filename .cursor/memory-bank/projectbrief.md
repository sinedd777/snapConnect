# SnapCircle - College-Focused Map-Based Ephemeral Sharing Platform

## Project Overview
SnapCircle is a mobile application for iOS and Android that enables college students to discover, join, and create location-based ephemeral sharing spaces ("Circles") on a map interface. Users can share photos, videos, and text within these Circles, which automatically expire after a set duration. The platform features AR filters, RAG-powered suggestions, and location-based discovery, all designed to enhance campus social experiences while maintaining privacy.

## Current Status
Authentication flow with email/password implemented, basic camera functionality working, and initial snap upload capability in place. Navigation structure established with auth, home, and camera screens. Friend management system, snap sharing workflow, and basic AR filter UI implemented. Pivoting to map-based interface with college town focus.

# Project Progress

## Overall Status
Project is pivoting from individual snap sharing to a map-based, college-focused Circle platform. Authentication, camera functionality, friend management, snap sharing, and basic AR filter UI are implemented. Firebase security rules and indexes have been configured. Material 3 design system has been implemented with enhanced UI components and a profile screen. Now transitioning to map-based interface with college town selection and RAG integration.

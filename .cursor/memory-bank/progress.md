# Project Progress

## Overall Status
Project is pivoting from individual snap sharing to a map-based, college-focused Circle platform. Authentication, camera functionality, friend management, snap sharing, and basic AR filter UI are implemented. Firebase security rules and indexes have been configured. Material 3 design system has been implemented with enhanced UI components and a profile screen. Map-based interface with location services, fullscreen mode, and circle display has been implemented. Screenshot prevention has been added for sensitive content. RAG integration has begun with OpenAI service implementation. Now focusing on enhancing the map experience, circle creation, and expanding RAG capabilities.

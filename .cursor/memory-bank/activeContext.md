# Active Context

## Authentication Status
- ✅ Email/Password Authentication: Implemented and tested successfully
- ✅ Google Sign-In: Implemented and tested successfully
- ✅ Firebase Integration: Configured and working properly

## Recent Changes
1. Successfully configured Firebase Authentication
2. Implemented Google Sign-In with proper SHA-1 fingerprint: `5E:8F:16:06:2E:A3:CD:2C:4A:0D:54:78:76:BA:A6:F3:8C:AB:F6:25`
3. Fixed Android build configuration to properly handle native modules
4. Resolved `google-services.json` persistence issues during builds

## Current Focus
- Authentication flow is complete and working
- Both authentication methods (Email/Password and Google Sign-In) are functioning correctly
- Native Android configuration is stable and builds successfully

## Active Decisions
1. Using Firebase for authentication backend
2. Using `@react-native-google-signin/google-signin` for Google authentication
3. Using `@react-native-firebase/auth` for Firebase authentication
4. Maintaining `google-services.json` in version control for easier development

## Next Steps
1. Consider implementing additional authentication methods if needed
2. Add error handling for edge cases
3. Implement user profile management
4. Add logout functionality
5. Consider implementing password reset functionality

## Current Decisions
1. Using Firebase JS SDK v9+ for modular imports
2. Implementing proper error handling for auth
3. Following Expo's Firebase integration guide
4. Using Expo Dev Client for native code support

## Active Decisions
1. Using Expo managed workflow for faster development
2. Firebase as the backend platform for scalability
3. TypeScript for type safety and better development experience
4. Cloud Functions with TypeScript for backend logic
5. Firestore for real-time data sync
6. Cloud Storage for media files

## Current Tasks

### Completed
- [x] Project structure setup
- [x] Initial dependency installation
- [x] Basic documentation
- [x] Firebase project initialization
- [x] Firebase services setup

### In Progress
- [ ] Firebase SDK integration in React Native app
- [ ] Environment configuration
- [ ] Security rules setup

### Up Next
1. Firebase SDK Integration
   - Install Firebase SDKs for React Native
   - Configure Firebase in the app
   - Set up environment variables

2. Security Rules Configuration
   - Firestore security rules
   - Storage security rules
   - Authentication rules

3. App Structure Setup
   - Navigation configuration
   - Screen components
   - Theme and styling
   - Type definitions

## Technical Debt
- Environment variables setup needed
- Firebase configuration in app pending
- Security rules need review and implementation
- Type definitions for Firebase responses needed

## Known Issues
- None at this stage

## Immediate Actions
1. Install Firebase SDKs:
   ```bash
   npm install @react-native-firebase/app
   npm install @react-native-firebase/auth
   npm install @react-native-firebase/firestore
   npm install @react-native-firebase/storage
   npm install @react-native-firebase/functions
   ```
2. Set up environment variables
3. Configure Firebase in the app
4. Implement security rules
5. Create basic app structure

## Questions to Resolve
1. Firebase configuration strategy (environment variables vs config file)
2. Security rules structure and best practices
3. Media storage organization
4. Push notification setup
5. Development vs Production environments

## Dependencies
- Firebase SDK integration (PENDING)
- Environment configuration (PENDING)
- Navigation structure (PENDING)
- Authentication flow (PENDING)

## Risk Assessment
1. Firebase configuration security
2. Phone authentication setup
3. Media storage security
4. Cross-platform compatibility

## Next Milestone
Firebase Integration & Basic App Structure
- Target: Complete Firebase SDK integration and basic app structure
- Status: Firebase services initialized
- Blockers: Firebase SDK integration pending
- Dependencies: Firebase configuration, environment setup
